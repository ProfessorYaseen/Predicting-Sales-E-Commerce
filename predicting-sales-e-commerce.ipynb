Sales forecasting is an important part of meeting customer expectations and provides insight into how the market will react to any given product.\n\n* We live in the world of e-commerce. We see tons of different stores here and there through the web. Internet made it possible to trade with anyone and everywhere. We can buy goods without leaving our house, we can compare prices in different stores within seconds, we can find what we really want and do not accept just the first more or less suitable offer. And I believe it would be really interesting to look at this world through the data it produces. That's why I decided to play around with e-commerce numbers and try to understand it better.\n\n* The data used in this analysis is taken from Kaggle dataset \"E-Commerce Data | Actual transactions of UK retailer\".\n\n* This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.\n\n* As always, we start our analysis by setting up our environment and by importing necessary libraries.\n\n* We import standard numpy and pandas to be able to perform analysis with Python, also we need data visualization libraries matplotlib and seaborn to output interesting visual findings.\nPredicting sales in e-commerce is a critical aspect of managing an online retail business. Accurate sales predictions can help you make informed decisions about inventory management, marketing strategies, and overall business growth. Here are some key methods and considerations for predicting sales in e-commerce:\n1. Historical Data Analysis:\n* Start by analyzing your historical sales data. Look at trends, seasonality, and any    patterns that may emerge. This data can provide valuable insights into past performance.\n2. Time Series Forecasting:\n* Time series forecasting methods, such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) or Prophet, can be used to predict future sales based on past sales data. These models take into account seasonality and trends.\n3. Machine Learning Models:\n\n* Machine learning models like regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks can be trained on historical data to make predictions. Feature engineering, which involves selecting and transforming relevant input features, is crucial for these models.\n4. Customer Segmentation:\n\n* Segment your customer base to identify different groups with varying buying behaviors. This can help you tailor marketing efforts and predict sales more accurately for each segment.\n5. External Factors:\n\n* Consider external factors that can influence sales, such as holidays, economic conditions, and industry trends. Incorporating these factors into your models can improve their accuracy.\n6. Inventory Management:\n\n* Accurate sales predictions are essential for inventory management. Overstocking or understocking can lead to lost sales or excess costs. Make sure your predictions align with your inventory levels.\n7. Marketing Campaign Analysis:\n\n* Analyze the impact of marketing campaigns on sales. Attribution modeling can help you understand which marketing efforts are driving the most sales, allowing you to optimize your marketing strategy.\n8. A/B Testing:\n\n* Conduct A/B tests to experiment with different strategies and determine which ones have the most significant impact on sales. This can help refine your predictions over time.\n9. Customer Feedback and Reviews:\n\n* Pay attention to customer feedback and product reviews. Negative feedback can lead to decreased sales, while positive feedback can boost sales. Monitor sentiment and address customer concerns promptly.\n10. Forecasting Tools:\n\n* Consider using specialized forecasting software or e-commerce analytics platforms that offer pre-built models and dashboards tailored for sales predictions.\n11. Continuous Monitoring and Iteration:\n\n* Sales prediction models should be regularly monitored and updated as new data becomes available. E-commerce is dynamic, and market conditions can change rapidly.\n12. Use of AI and Predictive Analytics:\n\n* Advanced artificial intelligence and predictive analytics techniques, such as deep learning and reinforcement learning, can provide more accurate and automated sales predictions, especially for large datasets.\n\nRemember that sales predictions are not always 100% accurate, but with consistent refinement and the use of various data sources and models, you can improve their accuracy over time. Additionally, be prepared to adapt your strategies based on the insights gained from your predictions to maximize your e-commerce success.\n\nOnline Retail Data Set: [Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Import Libraries","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\nplt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\n%matplotlib inline","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-06T15:11:04.722143Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-06T15:11:04.722591Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-06T15:11:05.716504Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-06T15:11:04.72255Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-06T15:11:05.715666Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nos.listdir(\"/kaggle/input/online-retail-dataset\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-06T15:11:05.71806Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-06T15:11:05.718457Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-06T15:11:05.729037Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-06T15:11:05.718431Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-06T15:11:05.727958Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/online-retail-dataset/OnlineRetail.csv\", encoding=\"latin\", dtype={'CustomerID': str})","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-06T15:11:05.730019Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-06T15:11:05.73028Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-06T15:11:07.094213Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-06T15:11:05.730256Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-06T15:11:07.093293Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-06T15:11:07.096278Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-06T15:11:07.096594Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-06T15:11:07.118726Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-06T15:11:07.096568Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-06T15:11:07.117907Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* Just by looking at the first 5 rows of our table, we can understand the structure and datatypes present in our dataset.\n* We can notice that we will have to deal with time series data, integers and floats, and categorical, and text data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* Every data science project starts with EDA as we have to understand what do we have to deal with.\n* I divide EDA into 2 types: visual and numerical.
